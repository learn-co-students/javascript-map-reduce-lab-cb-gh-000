    "body": "In the interest of trying to build more on why this reading could really use some work on explaining more on the why of REST. So you already covered that we like have urls that are consistent, but another virtue of REST is readable URLs. The old days of `myblog.com/9u9sf89` are gone! If you follow restful routes, if someone send an email with the url of your blog it will read `myblog.com/posts/1`. Easy to read. The other reason REST is powerful is it uses the power built in to HTTP of verb and resource. \r\n\r\nMuch of the CRUD actions are different actions that occur on the same resource. That's important to remember. When you are trying  access the post with id 4 we hit `posts/4`. But now I want to update that post. Am I hitting a different resoruce? nope! just doing a different action. So Instead of a `GET` against `post/4` let's do a `PUT`. That's what separating what you're talking to (the resource/noun) from the action you're doing (the http verb) is important! That's key to REST",

At that same debugger break-point, the dom is visibly missing an empty space for the list div. I checked to see the setFixtures() parameters in the test, and they were indeed missing the ul.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nAdd `<ul id=\"list\"></ul>` to the `#games` div, or just replace line 305 with:\r\n```\r\n    setFixtures('<body><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"40\"><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"0\">X</td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"0\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"0\"></td></tr><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"1\">O</td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"1\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"1\"></td></tr><tr><td data-x=\"0\", data-y=\"2\"></td><td data-x=\"1\", data-y=\"2\"></td><td data-x=\"2\", data-y=\"2\"></td></tr></table><div id=\"games\"><ul id=\"list\"></ul></div><div id=\"message\"></div><button id=\"save\">Save Game</button><button id=\"previous\">Show Previous Games</button></body>');\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now that the div has a permanent child, we just created a new problem with line 307:\r\n```\r\n#integration tests of persistence if i click the previous game button and a game has already been saved it should add the previous game to the DOM\r\nExpected 1 to be 0.\r\nError: Expected 1 to be 0.\r\n    at stack (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1293:17)\r\n    at buildExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1270:14)\r\n    at Spec.Env.expectationResultFactory (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:484:18)\r\n    at Spec.addExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:260:46)\r\n    at Expectation.addExpectationResult (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:442:21)\r\n    at Expectation.toBe (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1209:12)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (file:///Users/Roberto/Development/code/js-tictactoe-rails-api-v-000/spec/tictactoe.spec.js:307:43)\r\n    at attemptSync (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1510:12)\r\n    at QueueRunner.run (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1498:9)\r\n    at QueueRunner.execute (file:///Users/Roberto/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/learn-test-1.2.26/lib/learn_test/jasmine/jasmine.js:1485:10)\r\n```\r\nFix:\r\nChange line 307: `expect($(\"#games\").children().length).toBe(0);` to `expect($(\"#list\").children().length).toBe(0);`\r\n\r\nChange line 322: `expect($(\"#games\").children().length).toBe(1);` to `expect($(\"#list\").children().length).toBe(1);`\r\n\r\nThat is, assuming the ul originally has an id = list.

I could tweak the code to make most tests pass, except for this one: `rspec ./spec/02_services/github_service_spec.rb:68`.\r\n\r\nThe error message:\r\n```Failures:\r\n\r\n  1) GithubService #create_repo sends the correct POST request\r\n     Failure/Error: expect(stubbed).to have_been_requested\r\n       The request POST https://api.github.com/user/repos with body {\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"a-new-repo\\\"}\"=>nil} with headers {'Authorization'=>'token 1'} was expected to execute 1 time but it executed 0 times\r\n       \r\n       The following requests were made:\r\n       \r\n       POST https://api.github.com/user/repos with body '{\"name\":\"a-new-repo\"}' with headers {'Accept'=>'application/json', 'Accept-Encoding'=>'gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3', 'Authorization'=>'token 1', 'Content-Type'=>'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'User-Agent'=>'Faraday v0.9.1'} was made 1 time\r\n       \r\n       ============================================================\r\n     # ./spec/02_services/github_service_spec.rb:75:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\n\r\nFinished in 14.85 seconds (files took 2.8 seconds to load)\r\n1 example, 1 failure\r\n```\r\nThis error seems strange because a call is being made, and it seems to be successful.

    "body": "The Flatiron BNB Methods lab was difficult. The actual Ruby code was challenging, but doable. What was confusing were the associations. I know it's good to get stretched and challenged, but at the same time, I wish there was a more comprehensive lesson on these types of associations. I totally get that we need to supplement lessons with our own outside sources, but it almost feels as if the reading on this isn't sufficient. If the lab is going to test things like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nhas_many :trip_listings, :through => :trips, :source => :listing\r\nhas_many :hosts, :through => :trip_listings, :foreign_key => 'host_id' has_many :host_reviews, :through => :guests, :source => :reviews\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen there should at least be some information about sources and creating names like :trip_listings in a previous lesson, right? I spent A LOT of time doing outside reading on this. It seems really important to understand this.",

Upon initial cloning and trying to run \r\nfrom this issue raised by a student in student repo:\r\nlearn I received an error and was told to run rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test. However, when I did so I received this error message:\r\n\r\nSQLite3::SQLException: table \"users\" already exists: CREATE TABLE \"users\" (\"id\" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, \"username\" varchar, \"password_digest\" varchar) /Users/kaylee/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/gems/sqlite3-1.3.10/lib/sqlite3/database.rb:91:in `initialize'\r\n\r\n(full stack trace not included as it was very long)\r\n\r\nThis happened even after deleting the repo and forking/cloning again, and no matter with order I ran rake db:migrate and rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test in. The problem was eventually solved by deleting the following files: db/schema.rb and db/test.sqlite before running migrations.\r\n\r\nAlso, am not sure if the lab was intended to be just a codealong or if this was intentional, but several tests do not pass due to capybara not being able to find elements just as an FYI.",

    "body": "Hello! - Perhaps it was only , but I was a bit confused between how we were taught to output conditional statements in 'About Ruby conditionals' and its followup lab 'speaking-grandma'.\r\n\r\nThe original code I had written to solve for the lab was as follows:\r\n```\r\ndef speak_to_grandma(phrase)\r\n  if \"#{phrase}\" == \"#{phrase}\".upcase\r\n    puts \"NO, NOT SINCE 1938!\"\r\n  else\r\n    puts \"HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nPlease note the **puts** in the above. When I would run the code in my terminal using ```ruby grandma.rb``` and try running the test manually (i.e copying and pasting the exact phrases directly from the ```grandma_spec.rb``` and running them as the method's argument), I'd get exactly the desired results. Because everything in the previous lesson required string output be prefaced with \"puts\" or \"print\", I thought this was necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly thirty minutes of trying to solve this, I finally tried it *without* the ```puts``` and as below:\r\n```\r\ndef speak_to_grandma(phrase)\r\n  if \"#{phrase}\" == \"#{phrase}\".upcase\r\n    \"NO, NOT SINCE 1938!\"\r\n  else\r\n    \"HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis time it worked! (Yay!).\r\n\r\nI'm just running this by you in case others are having similar issues between the examples in the previous lesson and the requirements to pass the test. I will definitely read the tests more carefully next time, as well.\r\n\r\nThanks and I hope this helps!\r\n\r\nBeGreative",
